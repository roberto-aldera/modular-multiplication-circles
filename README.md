# Modular Multiplication Circles
## What is this?
A visualisation of modular arithmetic in a circle.
Each number has a dedicated circle, with links between each "tick" to the remainder when divided by the total number of ticks (where a sensible default is 360).
When links are connected, some cool patterns form.

## Some examples
